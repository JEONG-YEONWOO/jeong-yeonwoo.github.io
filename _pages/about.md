Hello, I am Yeonwoo JEONG from South Korea. You can call me "William".

I major in Medicine at Seoul National University, along with a double major in Psychology.

My current academic interests are as follows:
<p>1) The induction and progression of neurodegenerative pathology, especially Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, including the causal mechanisms within.</p>
<p>2) The role of glia and their delicate interactions with neurons in such proteinopathy.</p>
<p>3) Viewing neurodegeneration from a developmental perspective, particularly in terms of early-life stress (ELS).</p>
<p>4) Ultimately, the implications of the aforementioned on analogous psychiatric disorders such as anxiety & depression.</p>

(You can find out the research I contributed to in my [publications page](/al-folio/publications/). - to be modified later on)

Apart from academics, I have always had a big passion for music and the performing arts. Orchestral concerts and musicals are my favorites, and lately I developed a new interest in opera.
You can visit my [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ywj.cosmos/) for further details. Feel free to explore!
